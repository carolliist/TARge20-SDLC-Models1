    <td>
        &#9786; It creates a system of transparency - Daily scrums do more than keep workers accountable to their assignments. It is also a way for a company to maintain their transparency with their clients.
    </td>
    <td>
        &#9785; It does not care about the final project deadline - The scrum methodology uses personal deadlines to create a specific amount of work. It does not take the project deadline into account. The only real requirement is that each person or team meet expectations.       
    </td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>
        &#9786; It offers motivation on multiple levels - Teams are motivated using this methodology because there are defined deadlines and expectations to meet. Individuals are motivated by the rewards that are offered (or at least should be offered) for meeting or exceeding expectations. This system creates a stronger set of knowledge work that can be presented to the client.
    </td>
    <td>
        &#9785; It requires a team environment - Individuals can follow the concepts of scrum methodology, but this format is designed to work with a team of at least 3 people. It’s only suitable for small teams as well. If there are 10+ people involved, it doesn’t work as well.
    </td>

    <tr>
<td>
    &#9786; It provides continuous feedback - Because this methodology requires daily check-ins for progress reports, there is always feedback offered at the team and individual level. This helps to make the project better in the long run.
</td>
<td>
    &#9785; It requires experience - Feedback can be provided to teams and individuals through relevant experience only. If the individual or team that offers feedback is not experienced in the work being done, then the entire system breaks down.
