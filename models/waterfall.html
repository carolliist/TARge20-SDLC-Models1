<h2>Waterfall: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Advantages</th>
        <th>Disadvantages</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
            &#9786; Everyone gets up to speed quickly - Since technical documentation is a necessary part of the initial requirements phase, this means that everyone understands the objectives. New developers can get up to speed quickly – even during the maintenance phase.
        </td>
        <td>
            &#9785; Needs can be difficult to define - Clients may find it challenging to conceptualise their needs in terms of a functional specification during the requirements phase. This means that they may change their minds once they see the end product, which is difficult to address if the application needs to be re-engineered to any large extent.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
            &#9786; Timescales are kept - The phased development cycle enforces discipline. Each step has a clearly defined starting point and conclusion, which makes progress easy to monitor. This helps reduce any project “slippage” from agreed timescales.
        </td>
        <td>
            &#9785; Potential lack of flexibility - There may be issues with the flexibility of the model to cater for new developments or changes of requirements which may occur after the initial consultation. Changes due to business plans or market influences may not have been taken into account when planning is all done up front.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>
            &#9786; Testing is made easy - Test scenarios are already detailed in the functional specification of the requirements phase, which makes the testing process easier and more transparent.
        </td>
        <td>
            &#9785; Longer delivery time - Projects may take longer to deliver, compared to using an iterative methodology such as Agile.
        </td>
